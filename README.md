# Architecture-Supported Audit Processor

[![Build Status](https://osate-build.sei.cmu.edu/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=OSATE2-ASAP)](https://osate-build.sei.cmu.edu/jenkins/job/OSATE2-ASAP/)

The Architecture-Supported Audit Processor (ASAP) is a plugin to [OSATE](https://osate.org) that presents safety-specific representations of a system. Background and explanation can be found in the publication "Architecture-Supported Audit Processor: Interactive, Query-Driven Assurance" (currently unpublished, contact the repository maintainer for a preprint). 

## Installing ASAP

ASAP can be installed into OSATE (2.9.1+) by clicking `Help > Install Additional OSATE Components` in the top menu bar. Then select `ASAP (Safety Views)` and click `Finish`. Follow the standard installation process, and re-launch OSATE when prompted.

## Using ASAP

You can load an example model into your workspace by right-clicking in the AADL Navigator view, then selecting `New... > Example... >`, click `AADL Examples` then `Next >`. Expand `ASAP Examples` in the left panel, select the example you'd like to load, then click `Finish`.

### Specifying Safety Information

ASAP's representations pull from two sources of information about a system, AADL (with EMV2 information) and SAFE2 files.

AADL files can be opened and modified in the usual fashion, refer to the [osate documentation](https://osate.org/#user-docs) for more information.

One SAFE2 file per system context should be created; they can be modified by opening the file and then using the "Properties" view. Refer to the publication and / or [SAFE webpage](https://samprocter.com/safe) for an explanation of the individual elements.

### Viewing the System Representations

There are four representations of a system in ASAP (refer to the publication for an explanation of the benefits each particular representation is useful for). Two of the four (Containment and Unsafe Control Actions) can be generated by selecting a component instance, then selecting the relevant option from the `Analyses > Safety` menu in the top bar. The Connected Neighbors representation should be generated by right-clicking a component in  an existing representation (eg, Containment). The fundamentals representation can be generated by selecting a .safe2 file and selecting the relevant option from the `Analyses > Safety` menu in the top bar.

## Building ASAP

Follow the OSATE Development Environment [setup instructions](https://osate.org/setup-development.html), then click `File > Import... > Oomph > Projects from Catalog` and add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osate/osate2-asap/main/org.osate.asap.releng/asap.setup` Then re-run setup tasks and re-launch Eclipse.
