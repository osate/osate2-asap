	 * focus testing, do we still really want to use Sirius? It would be easier

	 * It's basically a tradeoff between slow, clunky tests and distance

	 * * Some tests should be written to test the java directly / more quickly
	 * * But sirius / swtbot should be used for logic embedded in the odesign file and
	 * for minimal testing of the whole thing (ie, integration / system level tests)
